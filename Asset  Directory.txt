PLACING AND NAMING RULES:

tracks
    straight tracks are named "<tech> straight track.png"
        ex: "basic straight track.png"
    end tracks are named "<tech> track end.png", and should be placed instead of out-straight tracks when there is a fatal obstacle ahead
        ex: "basic track end.png"
    at every junction tick, place "<tech> node track.png" piece. this lets the train enter the junction from a straight track, and to let the train leave, going straight and/or 
    up and/or down, you need to place additional pieces. if the train leaves a junction going any direction other than straight, it will move one unit vertically(up or down) 
    and one unit horizontally (forward).

        pieces that allow the train to exit the junction node in different directions:
            to allow the train to exit this junction node going up, place "<tech> out-top track.png".
                ex: "basic out-up track.png"
            to allow the train to exit this junction node going down, place "<tech> out-down track.png"
                ex: "basic out-down track.png"
            to allow the train to exit this junction node going straight, place "<tech> out-straight track.png"
                ex: "basic out-stright track.png"

stations
    Stations occupy 2 junctions, and are placed at the first junction. there are 3 styles of station, all of which behave the same:
        to place a station that is visually above the track, place "<biome> top station.png"
            ex: "desert top station.png"
        to place a station that visually surrounds the track, place "<biome> full station.png"
            ex: "desert full station.png"
        to place a station that is visually below the track, place "<biome> down station.png"
            ex: desert down station.png"

locomotives and wagons
    To add the front of a train, place "<tech> locomotive.png"
        ex: "basic locomotive.png"
    To add a passenger wagon, place "<tech> passenger wagon.png"
        ex: "basic passenger wagon.png"


TRACK EXAMPLE:
(the curly brackets indicate the location of the images, following the Phaser convetion of higher Y values representing lower points on the screen)

( {0,0}: "basic track track.png")  ({1, 0} "basic node track.png" )({1,0} "basic out-straight track.png"){{1,0} "basic out-down.png"}   ({2, 0} "basic track straight")   ({3, 0} "basic node track.png")({3, 0} "basic out-straight.png")

( {0,1}: "basic track track.png")  ({1, 1} "basic node track.png" )({1,1} "basic out-straight track.png")   ({2, 1} "basic track straight")   ({3, 1} "basic node track.png")({3, 1} "basic out-straight.png")

the above placements would create the following two tracks:

==== =O= ==== =O= 
      \\
       L=====v
              \\
==== =O= ==== =O=

where the top-left intersection allows the train to leave or stay on the top track, and the bottom right intersection is where the train joins the bottom track from the top.


Backgrounds
    each biome has a single bbackground tileSprite named "<biome> background.png"
        ex: "desert background.png"
    when the player has nearly completed a biome, place a transition image to blend to the next biome, called "<oldBiome> to <newBiome> blend.png"
        ex: "desert to mountain blend.png"

Obstacles
    there are two obstacles per biome. The first kind kills the train, and is placed after junctions. the other kind is placed on straight tracks, and just slows/damages the train
    The deadly obstacles are named "<biome> deadly obstacle.png"
        ex: "desert deadly obstacle.png"
    The debris obstacles are named "<biome> debris obstacle.png"
        ex: "desert debris obstacle.png"
